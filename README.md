# DDPG toy problem:
The toy problem consists of a random state initialized between 0 and 0.7 or between 0.8 and 1.5. The goal of the agent is to return continuos actions so that the next state ends up being between 0.7 and 0.8.
This environment was used to test our DDPG. Our DDPG succeeds in reaching an optimal policy within 700 episodes approx. 90% of the time.
