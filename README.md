# DDPG toy problem:
The toy problem consists of a random state initialized between 0 and 0.725 or between 0.775 and 1.5. The goal of the agent is to return continuos actions so that the next state ends up being between 0.725 and 0.775.
This environment was used to test our DDPG. Our DDPG succeeds in reaching an optimal policy within 700 episodes approx. 90% of the time.
